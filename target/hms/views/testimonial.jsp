                  <p>I had a grand stay at the Wilshire!</p>
                  <p>Upon arriving, I found myself warmly greeted  from the very first person I met, Danielle. She explained everything I had  available (breakfast daily, free wireless internet access), and took time to  give me restaurant recommendations as well as directions.</p>
                  <p>Entering the room, it was clean. The bathroom  was also spacious and very clean. The bed was very comfortable and the pillows  were just right.</p>
                  <p>Very rich and tasty breakfast, although the  breakfast staff wasn't the most pleasant. I would stay at the hotel again if in  the area!</p>

                  <p>Even though I was in town for work&nbsp; and  got stranded due to the winter storm my stay at your hotel was very very  pleasant.&nbsp; The front desk staff handled the situation of people checking  out and back in&nbsp; with courtesy and efficiency.&nbsp; The little chocolates  were a &quot;sweet&quot; surprise and an example of your hotel going the extra  mile with nice touches.</p>
                  <p>Many thanks to the staff</p>

                  <p>Good morning! </p>
                  <p>I was a guest of the Bodnovich wedding party and I meant to fill out a comment  card before I left but I was in a rush! I just wanted to tell you that I had a  wonderful time! Your hotel is beautiful. The staff was very friendly, in  particular Danielle who had checked me out. When I checked out in the morning  she helped us with directions and answered all of our questions which we  appreciated because we saw how hectic it was with everyone coming down at  once.&nbsp; Keep up the good work and please thank your staff for all their  help! We will for sure recommend your hotel to others.</p>
                  <p>Have a great week,<br />

                  <p>Hi Ed,</p>
                  <p>I just wanted to extend a huge thank you for arranging for  the suite last night.&nbsp; It exceeded my expectations.&nbsp; What  a&nbsp;beautiful room!!&nbsp; Everything was just perfect.</p>
                  <p>Again, thank you so much, and I will most definitely speak  highly of your services and the hotel.&nbsp; </p>

                  <p>Hi </p>
                  <p>I wanted to send you a heart felt thanks  for all of your efforts. Our guests thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. They all  raved about the &quot;cushy, comfy beds&quot;. We did end up going into  Primavera on Saturday night and Julio was a delight.</p>
                  <p>Thank you for also arranging the shuttle  bus to the reception. It worked out perfectly.</p>
                  <p>In this day and age, it is so refreshing to  find people and companies that still place a value on customer service. You  were a delight to work with and I cannot thank you enough. If you ever need a  reference or anything, please do not hesitate to contact me.</p>
                  <p>All the best, Meryl </p>

                  <p>I wanted to take this opportunity to tell you how  pleased we were with dealing with your hotel.&nbsp; You made everything so easy  for us, leading up to my daughter's wedding day and our stay at your hotel was  delightful.&nbsp; The rooms are lovely, the breakfast buffet was delicious and  our entire group of guest had a wonderful time despite the blizzard that was  taking place outside.&nbsp; Many of our guest used the shuttle service to and  from Mayfair Farms and it was such a convenience for them and a relief for me  that they would arrive safe to and from their destination.</p>
                  <p>I have already recommended your&nbsp;hotel to a number of my friends and will  continue to do so.</p>
                  <p>Once again,&nbsp; thank you for all your help.&nbsp; Enjoy this holiday season  and all the best to you in the new year.&nbsp;</p>
